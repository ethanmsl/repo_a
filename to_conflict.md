0  : in xanadu did kubla khan
1  : a stately pleasure dome decree
2  : where alph the sacred river ran
3  : through caverns measureless to man
4  : down to a sunless see
5  : so twice five miles of fertile ground
6  : with towers and towers were gilded round
7  : and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
8  : a dasmel with a dulcimer
9  : in a vision I once saw
10 : that with music loud and long
11 : I would build that dome in air
