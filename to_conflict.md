0 : in xanadu did kubla khan
1 : a stately pleasure dome decree
2 : where alph the sacred river ran
3 : through caverns measureless to man
4 : down to a sunless see
5 : so twice five miles of fertile ground
6 : with towers and towers were gilded round
7 : and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
